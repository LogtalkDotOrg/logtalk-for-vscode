// Benefits of the new approach:
console.log(`
Benefits of the new in-memory approach:

1. NON-PERSISTENT: State is cleared when VS Code restarts or terminal closes
2. NO WORKSPACE POLLUTION: Doesn't persist data in workspace state
3. BETTER PERFORMANCE: Set operations are O(1) for has() and add()
4. CLEANER CODE: No need to manage workspace state keys
5. AUTOMATIC CLEANUP: Memory is freed when extension unloads
6. THREAD-SAFE: No concurrent access issues with workspace state
7. PREDICTABLE: Fresh state on each session, no stale data
8. SIMPLIFIED LOGIC: Core directory is pre-added, eliminating special case handling

Key optimizations made:
- Core directory is automatically added when terminal is created
- checkCodeLoadedFromDirectory() no longer needs to compute/compare core path
- Removed workspace configuration access from the check function
- Cleaner, more efficient code with fewer dependencies

The old workspaceState approach could cause issues because:
- Data persisted across VS Code sessions
- Could accumulate stale directory paths
- Required manual cleanup of workspace state keys
- Slower iteration over all keys for checking parent directories
- Required core directory computation on every check
