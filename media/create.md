Create a Logtalk project.

The Logtalk distribution includes several sample files to help you get started in a new project.

To configure your Logtalk startup settings, copy and modify the following file to your project folder:

- `settings-sample.lgt`

To load the source files of your project, copy and modify the following file:

- `loader-sample.lgt`

To write tests for your project, copy and modify the following files:

- `tester-sample.lgt`
- `tests-sample.lgt`

The `coding` directory also contains an EditorConfig file and "ignore" files for several source code management systems such as git.
